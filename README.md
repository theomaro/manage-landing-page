### Continued development

Some of the areas that I wish to continue focusing on in future projects are:-

### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss Official Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - The Documentation is amazing, helps me a lot with example code and explanations.
- [Tailwind Crash Course | Project From Scratch]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00gyCtIQp8E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFgzHOX84xQ)) - This is an amazing project based tutorial which helped me finally understand tailwindcss framework to build a website. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [How To Create An Image Slider In HTML, CSS & Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcdBOoK3Pfw) - This is an amazing video which helped me finally understand how to create image slider to show different content. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
